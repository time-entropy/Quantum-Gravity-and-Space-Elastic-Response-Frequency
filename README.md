## Space Elastic Response Frequency

Gravity fundamentally stems from its mediation by elastic bonds(sub-Planckian constituents) between SEQ rather than direct SEQ interactions.

When the resonant frequency of SEQ significantly exceeds the elastic response frequency of inter-SEQ bonds, gravitational field mediation does not encode SEQ's spectral fingerprints.

The method of gravitational wave frequency detection implies that the detected frequency range should fall within the spatial elastic response frequency range. As our understanding of gravitational wave frequencies expands, so too will our knowledge of the spatial elastic response frequency range.
